AI CHAT — PREMIUM UI/UX DESIGN SPECIFICATION

GOAL
Create a premium-level AI chat interface that feels calm, minimalistic, modern, and elegant.
No visual noise. No admin-panel feeling. Everything must look like a real polished product.

CORE PRINCIPLES
• Minimalism
• Soft depth (not flat, not textured)
• Fully adaptive layout
• Smooth motion
• No overlay popups blocking content

SCREEN STRUCTURE
The interface has 3 zones:

1. Left panel – chats and spaces
2. Center – chat conversation
3. Right panel – system panel (RAG / Logs / Settings)

Panels are part of layout. They shift content, never cover it.

ADAPTIVE LAYOUT
All sizes must be relative:
• Percent-based layout
• Relative spacing
• Min/max constraints

Interface must look correct on small laptop, large monitor, ultrawide, split screen.

SOFT DEPTH STYLE
No textures, no grain.

Depth created by:
• subtle inner borders
• soft wide shadows
• slight gradients
• subtle glow for active items

Four depth levels:
Background → Chat → Panels → Active elements.

COLOR STYLE
• Dark graphite background
• Slightly lighter panels
• Soft blue/violet accent
• No neon colors

PANELS BEHAVIOR
Left panel:
• Slides left when closed
• Center expands smoothly

Right panel:
• Slides right
• Right-side buttons move with it
• Panel never overlaps buttons or chat

Panel modes switch inside container:
RAG / Logs / Settings.

AVATAR AND MODEL SELECTOR
One agent avatar at top-left of chat.

Model selector opens as a premium popover under avatar.

Model dropdown must include:
• search field
• model cards with description
• soft hover highlight
• subtle animation

No standard dropdown UI.

RAG PANEL — UI REQUIREMENTS
RAG looks like a real file explorer.

Structure:
• Header with knowledge base name

• Folder tree
• File metadata preview
• Footer stats

File system behavior:
• Drag & drop
• Rename
• Move
• Delete (soft delete)
• Multi-select

• Empty

MICRO-ANIMATIONS
